# Authentication

Kangaroo uses API keys to allow access to the API.

Kangaroo expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: asdfghjkl...`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>asdfghjkl...</code> with your personal API key.
